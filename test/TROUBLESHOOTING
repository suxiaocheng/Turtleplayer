Problem: !!! JUnit version 3.8 or later expected:

Solution:
This problem happens because Android Platform (android.jar) already contains JUnit classes. IDEA test runner loads
these classes and sees that they are from the old JUnit, while you are trying to use annotated tests which
is a feature of the new JUnit, therefore you get the error from the test runner.
The solution is simple, open the Project Structure | Modules | Dependencies, and move the junit-4.7.jar up,
so that it comes before Android 1.6 Platform in the classpath. Now the test runner will be happy as it loads the
new JUnit version.
